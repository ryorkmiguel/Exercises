 * GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.
 * A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and 
 * multiply common factors.
 *
 * 36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
 * 60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
 * 
 * GCD = Mulitplication of common
 * 	   = 2 x 2 x 3
 *     = 12
 *
 * Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD 
 * If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), 
 * GCD doesnâ€™t change. 
 * So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, 
 * we end up with GCD.    
 * 
 * Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, 
 * the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
